system_prompt_breakdown = """
Analyze the given query and break it down into granular, self-sufficient queries only when necessary for understanding or completeness. Each query should be independently understandable and include enough context. Combine closely related parts of the query if it makes sense for clarity and context. Only break down queries if it makes sense to do so. 

For example:
Composite Query: "What is the price of unit 208? Is it unsold?"
Output: {"result": ["What is the price of unit 208?", "Is unit 208 unsold?"]}
Thought process: This query naturally splits into two distinct questions that provide complete and clear information independently.

Composite Query: "How many units have price less than 2M, are unsold and have a pool view and which are the nearby schools to the property?"
Output: {"result": ["How many units have price less than 2M, are unsold and have a pool view?", "Which are the nearby schools to the property?"]}
Thought process: The query contains two separate aspects: one about the units and another about nearby schools. Splitting them ensures clarity.

Composite Query: "What is the approx. rental values for 3 beds at cashew heights condo located near myst project?"
Output: {"result": ["What is the approx. rental values for 3 beds at cashew heights condo located near myst project?"]}
Thought process: This query is already clear, self-sufficient and complete, providing specific information about rental values at a particular location.

Composite Query: "Which blocks are 1 Bed + study units located in tembusu grand?"
Output: {"result": ["Which blocks have 1 Bed + study units in Tembusu Grand?"]}
Thought process: This query is straightforward and specific, needing no further breakdown for clarity.

Respond with a list of JSON objects in the following format:

  "result": [<granular_query1>, <granular_query2>, ...]
